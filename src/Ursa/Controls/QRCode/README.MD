# QrCode control

Important: this control was copied from Avalonia.Labs and is included here under the terms of the MIT License.

Source and attribution
- Original implementation: Avalonia.Labs
- Upstream project: https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.Labs

License
- The original code is distributed under the MIT License. We include the code here with the original copyright and license intact.
- See the LICENSE file in this repository for the full MIT license text.

Why this copy exists
- Convenience: the QrCode control is a small, self-contained control. Including a local copy lets users of Ursa.Avalonia use this control without adding the entire Avalonia.Labs NuGet package as a dependency.
- Minimal footprint: some consumers prefer to avoid pulling additional packages when they only need a single, simple control.

Notes and recommendations
- Maintenance: because this code is a copy, it may not receive the same updates or bug fixes as the upstream Avalonia.Labs package. If you need the latest features or fixes, prefer referencing the original Avalonia.Labs package via NuGet.
- Compatibility: this copy is intended to work with the versions of Avalonia used by Ursa.Avalonia. If you upgrade Avalonia or encounter issues, check the upstream project for fixes or updates.
- Attribution: please preserve the original copyright and license header in any modified files as required by the MIT license.

If you prefer to use the official package instead of this local copy, add the Avalonia.Labs package to your project (for example via NuGet) and remove the local control from your project.
